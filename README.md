### Repository Management ###
Once you have been granted access by the repo owner to clone the repository, you should create a local copy.
Then import the project into your Eclipse development environment

This project has been developed with JRE 1.8 SE, to run on TomCat 7.0, using JSF 2.2

Before carrying ANY development/coding/changes on the project files/code
- Checkout to the Remote Monitored development branch of the repo and choose the option to create a new local branch.
- Ensure your source is the development branch, not the master branch
- Name this local branch "development" also
- When beginning code, first create a new feature branch, from your local development branch
- checkout your local feature branch
- complete your work on your own local FEATURE branch

When work is completed and you want to merge it to your local development branch:
- checkout your local development branch
- Select your feature branch to merge into your development branch

Before pushing ANY changes from your local development branch to the remote development branch:
- pull from the remote repo first, to include any updates from other sources.
- then commit your changes, with appropriate comments
- push to remote development branch

Unless you are the repo owner, DO NOT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES carry out ANY work on teh master branch of the repo
